# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
This map animation project overlays a map with a marker icon that tracks the bus locations from MIT to Harvard. 
Once the map was sourced from MapBox using an access token, the marker was created at the location of the MIT campus. 
Using an array of bus stop coordinates, the program moves the marker from stop to stop in one-second increments once the button is clicked.
To run the program, click the button on the top left of the web page and watch the marker move.

Next in this repository, I plan to add more information to these markers. For example, I want to add estimated time of arrival for each marker/stop as well as to check which route the bus is taking. I also want to include more traffic data, such as level of traffic at that time of day, etc.
